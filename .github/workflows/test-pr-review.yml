            Analyze ONLY the code changes introduced by this pull request using git diff.
            Perform a comprehensive security review of the changed code:
            - Look for API key exposure, hardcoded secrets, credential leaks
            - Check for injection vulnerabilities (SQL, command, XSS)
            - Identify privilege escalation risks
            - Find unsafe file operations or path traversal issues
            - Detect insecure data handling or storage
            - Review authentication/authorization logic
            - Check for unsafe deserialization or parsing
            Focus on both code quality and security vulnerabilities.
            Provide specific, actionable security recommendations.
            Keep the response concise and focused on the PR changes.
